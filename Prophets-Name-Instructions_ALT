Family Name:  Prophets


Here are 2 lists of names if you do not want to use the single name list in the "Family_Prophets" respoitory.

This one is set up like the Daebak Family, in that there are two lists, one for first names, another for Last names.

I wanted to see the variation of using just one list, but also realize that it may be easier and faster 
to create the full names with 2 seperate lists.  If you would rather do that, here it is.

Naming instructions:
Like the Daebak Family names, please randomly select one name from the "Prophets_First_Names" list for the first name.
Or from "Prophets_First_Names.txt"

Please randomly select one name from the "Prophets_Last_Names" list for the last name.
Or from "Prophets_Last_Names.txt"


Images:
There is also a zip file attached. "Prophet_Images_1-6.zip" contains the 6 pony images.

Please randomly assign the images to a name when created.

Thx!
